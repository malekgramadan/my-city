                Beirut’s history stretches back to the Bronze Age, when it was a thriving 
                Phoenician port known as Berytus. It later became a Roman colony under 
                Emperor Augustus and was famous for its prestigious law school in the 3rd 
                century AD. After earthquakes and conquests, it flourished under the Ottomans
                (1516–1918) as a trade hub before becoming part of French Mandate Lebanon 
                (1920–1943). Traces of these eras remain in ruins like the Roman Baths and 
                Ottoman-era buildings in Downtown Beirut.

            <p class = "text-format">
                In the 1950s–60s, Beirut was the glamorous epicenter of the Arab world, 
                drawing celebrities (like Brigitte Bardot), intellectuals, and bankers. 
                The Corniche (seaside promenade), luxury hotels like the St. George, and 
                jazz clubs like Cave du Roy embodied its golden age. The civil war (1975–1990)
                shattered this image, but pockets of its old charm survive in renovated 
                areas like Gemmayzeh and Sursock.

            <p class = "text-format">
                Due to Lebanon’s French Mandate past, French is widely used in education and
                media, alongside Arabic. English dominates business and pop culture, creating
                a unique trilingual mix. Street signs, menus, and conversations often blend 
                all three—sometimes in the same sentence! The American University of Beirut 
                (AUB) and Université Saint-Joseph reinforce this global identity.
