                Beirut’s history stretches back to the Bronze Age, when it was a thriving 
                Phoenician port known as Berytus. It later became a Roman colony under 
                Emperor Augustus and was famous for its prestigious law school in the 3rd 
                century AD. After earthquakes and conquests, it flourished under the Ottomans
                (1516–1918) as a trade hub before becoming part of French Mandate Lebanon 
                (1920–1943). Traces of these eras remain in ruins like the Roman Baths and 
                Ottoman-era buildings in Downtown Beirut.
