                Beirut, the vibrant capital of Lebanon, is a city of striking contrasts, 
                where modern skyscrapers stand alongside historic Ottoman and French colonial 
                architecture. Known as the "Paris of the Middle East," it boasts a rich cultural 
                scene, lively nightlife, and world-renowned cuisine. Despite its tumultuous history, 
                including civil war and recent port explosions, Beirut remains resilient, 
                blending Mediterranean charm with a dynamic urban energy. 
                The city's seaside promenade, bustling markets, and thriving arts community 
                make it a captivating destination.
