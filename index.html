                Beirut, the vibrant capital of Lebanon, is a city of striking contrasts, 
                where modern skyscrapers stand alongside historic Ottoman and French colonial 
                architecture. Known as the "Paris of the Middle East," it boasts a rich cultural 
                scene, lively nightlife, and world-renowned cuisine. Despite its tumultuous history, 
                including civil war and recent port explosions, Beirut remains resilient, 
                blending Mediterranean charm with a dynamic urban energy. 
                The city's seaside promenade, bustling markets, and thriving arts community 
                make it a captivating destination.

                In the picture above is Hamra. Hamra is Beirut’s lively cultural and intellectual hub, blending old-world 
                charm with modern energy. Known for its historic cafés, bookshops, and the 
                American University of Beirut (AUB), it buzzes with students, artists, and 
                nightlife. Despite the city’s struggles, Hamra remains a symbol of Beirut’s 
                resilient, cosmopolitan spirit.
